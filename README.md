# cisc5550-todo-app

This repository contains two Python Flask applications - one is a Web Service (in the folder `api/`) and other is a web application (in the folder `webapp/`). Each were deployed to Google Cloud (the API Service using the Compute Engine, the Web App using Docker/Kubernetes). This was all for assignment 4 of CISC 5550 Cloud Computing at Fordham University.

The Docker image is:
`tnoone125/todolist_webapp:latest`

You may access the web application through its external IP:
